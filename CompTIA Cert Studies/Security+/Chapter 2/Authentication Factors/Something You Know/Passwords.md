## Password Complexity

A strong password is of sufficient length, doesn't include words found in a dictionary or any part of a user's name, and combines at least three of the four following character types:
	- Uppercase characters (A-Z)
	- Lowercase characters (a-z)
	- Numbers (0-9)
	- Special characters (!, $, &)
A complex password uses multiple character types, such as Ab0@. However, a complex password is not necessarily strong. It also needs to be sufficiently long. Many current recommendations suggest a length of at least 8 characters.

## Password Keys

Used to reset passwords on systems. Commonly a bootable optical disc or bootable USB flash drive. These allow you to recover or reset all user and admin passwords. Useful to users who have forgotten their passwords, forensic experts who need access to a computer and attackers.
