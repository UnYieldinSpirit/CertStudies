#Authentication 
Used to prove the identity of individuals. There are two types: static and dynamic.
Static KBA is used to verify your identity when you've forgotten your password. After creating an account, you're asked to answer questions about yourself. When you try to retrieve a forgotten password, you're first prompted to answer those same questions

Dynamic KBA identifies individuals without an account. The site queries public and private data sources, such as credit reports or third-party organizations. It then crafts multiple-choice questions that on the user would know and often includes an answer similar to "none of these apply". Users have a limited time to answer, to prevent attackers from researching answers.
