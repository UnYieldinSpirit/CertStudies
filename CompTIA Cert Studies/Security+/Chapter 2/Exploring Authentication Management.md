[[Authentication]] proves on identity through some type of credentials.
[[Identification]] occurs when users claim their identity with identifiers.

At least two entities know the credentials. One entity, the user, presents the credentials. The other entity is the authenticator that verifies the credentials.

Access control can not exist without authentication. Without authentication, you can't identify a user. If everyone is anonymous, then everyone has the same access to all resources.

Authentication is not limited to users. Services, processes, workstations, servers and network devices all use authentication to prove their identities.
