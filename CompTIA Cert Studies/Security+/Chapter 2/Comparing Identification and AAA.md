#Authentication #Authorization #Identification #Accounting #AccessControl 

Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) work together with [[identification]] to provide a comprehensive access management system.

Just because identity is proven, does not mean access is granted to all resources. Instead, users are granted authorization to access resources based on their proven identity.

Accounting methods track user activity and record the activity in logs. Audit logs track activity, and admins use these to create an audit trail. Audit trails allow security professionals to re-create the events that preceded a security incident.

Effective access control starts with strong authentication mechanisms, such as robust passwords, smart cards, or biometrics. If users can bypass the authentication process, authorization and accounting process are ineffective.
