#CIA #Integrity

[[Integrity]] - provides assurances that the data has not changed
	- When unauthorized or unintended changes occur, the data has lost its integrity
	- Hashes are technique used to determine if the integrity of an object is still intact. If the original hash matches the hash of the sent object, then integrity is preserved. If not, then integrity is lost
