Mostly used to provide an ongoing review of the organization's ability to reduce and manage risk
Two managerial controls:
	- Risk assessments - These help organizations quantify and qualify risks within an organization so that they can focus on the serious risks
		- Quantitative risk assessments use cost and asset values to quantify risks based on monetary values
		- Qualitative risk assessments use judgments to categorize risks based on probability and impact
	- Vulnerability assessment - Attempts to discover current vulnerabilities. When necessary, additional controls are implemented to reduce the risks from these vulnerabilities
