Attempt to detect when vulnerabilities have been exploited, resulting in a security incident. Examples:
	- Log monitoring - Several different logs record details of activity on systems and networks.
	- [[Security Information and Event Management Systems (SIEM)]] - In addition to monitoring logs to detect any single incident, you can also use SIEMs to detect trends and raise alerts in real time. By analyzing post alerts, you can identify trends, such as an increase of attacks on a specific system
	- Security audit - Can examine the security posture of an organization. For example, an audit can determine if personnel and technical policies are implementing account policies correctly.
	- Video Surveillance - A closed-circuit television (CCTV) system can record the activity and detect events that have occurred. Can also be a deterrent.
	- Motion detection - Many alarm systems can detect motion from potential intruders and raise alarms.
	- [[Intrusion Detection System (IDS)]] - Can detect malicious traffic after it enters a network. It typically raises an alarm to notify IT personnel of a potential attack.
