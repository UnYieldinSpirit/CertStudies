There are hundreds, even thousands, of security controls, but here are the CompTIA covered ones:
	- [[Managerial Controls]]
	- [[Operational Controls]]
	- [[Technical Controls]]
	- [[Preventive Controls]]
	- [[Detective Controls]]
	- [[Corrective Controls]]
	- [[Deterrent Controls]]
	- [[Compensating Controls]]
	- [[Physical Controls]]
	- [[Response Controls]]

Control categories and control types are not mutually exclusive, meaning that you can describe most controls using more than one category and more than one type.
