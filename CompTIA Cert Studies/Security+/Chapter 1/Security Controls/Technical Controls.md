Uses technology to reduce vulnerabilities
Here are a few technical controls:
	- [[Encryption]] - Used to protect the confidentiality of data. Includes data transferred over a network and stored on a device
	- [[Antivirus software]] - Provides protection against malware infection
	- [[Intrusion Detection System (IDS)]] and [[Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)]] - IDSs and IPSs can monitor a network or host for intrusions and provide ongoing protection against various [[Threat]]s.
	- [[Firewalls]] - Restrict network traffic going in and out of a network
	- Least Privilege - Specifies that individuals or processes are granted only the privileges they need to perform their assigned tasks or function, but no more. Privileges are a combination of rights and permissions.
