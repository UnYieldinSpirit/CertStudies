These controls are primarily implemented and executed by people instead of systems.
Operational Controls include the following families:
	-**Awareness and Training** - Training to reduce risks can not be overstated. Training helps users maintain password security, follow a clean desk policy, understand threats such as phishing, malware, and much more.
	- **Configuration management** - Uses baselines to ensure that systems start in a secure, hardened state. Change management helps ensure that changes don't result in unintended configuration errors
	- **Media protection** - Includes physical media such as USB flash drives, external and internal drives, and backup tapes
	- **Physical and environmental protection** - Includes physical controls such as cameras, door locks, and environmental controls such as heating and ventilation systems
